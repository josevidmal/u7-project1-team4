# Trip Planner

### Description 

This project is a website that allows the user to see quickly and in one glance the most essential information about a country they are interested to travel to. The user will get the basic information of a country, the exchange rate between the country's currency and USD and will also get information about the current covid levels in their target country without having to search in different sites. This will provide the user basic and important information to start planning a trip.

### How to use

The user can type in a country to search for. The website has a built-in autocomplete option so it makes it easier for the user to select a country without having to type it all or think about how to spell it. After clicking on the name of the selected country the user can just click search and they will obtain the information.

### Roadmap

This website allows for many different features to be implemented in the future, where we can keep adding sections to provide more information for travelers. We hope to keep expanding the project to include things like a clock to display local time, travel tips, suggested destinations, etc. all to contribute for an easier planning and give the user the base to start planning a trip.
